## Description

`go-dblib` is a shared library for [`go-ase`][purego] and
[`cgo-ase`][cgo]. These are driver-implementations for the
[`database/sql`][pkg-database-sql] package of [Go (golang)][go] to
provide access to SAP ASE instances.

SAP ASE is the shorthand for [SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise][sap-ase],
a relational model database server originally known as Sybase SQL
Server.

## Requirements

The package `go-dblib` is a shared library for the
driver-implementations of [`go-ase`][purego] and [`cgo-ase`][cgo]. Thus, one of
these implementations is required.

## Download and Installation

The packages in this repo can be `go get` and imported as usual.

```sh
go get github.com/SAP/go-dblib/<package>
```

## Usage (Example)

By importing `go-dblib` there are several use-cases. For example, the
`dsn`-package can be used to set up DSN information that is required to
connect to the ASE-database by using a connector.

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"

    "github.com/SAP/go-dblib/dsn"
    "github.com/SAP/go-ase"
)

func main() {
    d := dsn.NewInfo()
    d.Host = "hostname"
    d.Port = "4901"
    d.Username = "user"
    d.Password = "pass"

    connector, err := ase.NewConnector(*d)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to create connector: %v", err)
        return
    }

    db, err := sql.OpenDB(connector)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to open database: %v", err)
        return
    }
    defer db.Close()

    if err := db.Ping(); if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to ping ASE: %v", err)
    }
}
```

## Unit tests
